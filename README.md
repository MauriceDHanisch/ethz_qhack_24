- `Other`: Contains additional files and information.
- `results`: Contains the QAOA results in a CSV format.
- `src`: Contains the source code for the project.
- `FINAL_QHACK.pptx`: Contains the final presentation for the project.
- `Final_Submission.ipynb`: Contains the final submission for the project as a Jupyter Notebook.


## Challenge and solution overview
The given instructions can be found in the following [pdf file](Other/ETHZ_QHack_2024_NVIDIA.pdf). We will summarize the main points here.






## Other Challenges
Our project was selected as the winner of the NVIDIA challenge. Within the hackathon, we competed against the other challenges' winners and were awarded first place overall after presenting our solutions. We summarize the other challenges below.

### Moody’s x QuEra
MIS in complex graphs and applications in finance. The challenge was investigating the quantum speed-up in computing the MIS of defective king’s lattice graphs with connectivity via unit-disks of the order of 3 times the grid lattice constant and then finding an application in risk analysis and finance. 

### Quantinuum
The challenge was to investigate the normal forms of quantum circuits and their use for T gate optimization. The challenge repo can be found [here](https://github.com/CQCL/ethz-hack-24/). 

### Qilimanjaro
The challenge was about using quantum optimization algorithms on analog quantum hardware to solve the knapsack problem. It was needed to solve the problem with the least number of qubits to make it NISQ-compatible. The last part of the challenge was to work on the exact hardware model and simulate the results. 

### Pasqal
The challenge was about implementing Differentiable Quantum Circuits (DQC) [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10395) using Qadence. The goal was to implement a DQC to solve a 2D Laplace equation. As a bonus, it was proposed to use Harmonic quantum neural networks [[2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07462) to improve the results. The instructions repo can be found [here](https://github.com/pasqal-io/eth_quantum_2024).
